apple-search-ads-go is a Go client library for accessing Apple's [Apple Search Ads API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_search_ads).

This library is heavily inspired by [asc-go](https://github.com/cidertool/asc-go).

## Usage

This project uses Go Modules. It requires **Go 1.16 or higher**.

```go
import "github.com/rhinonet/apple-search-ads-go/asa"
```

Construct a new Apple Search Ads client, then use the various services on the client to access different parts of the Apple Search Ads API. For example:

```go
client := asa.NewClient(nil)

params := &asa.SearchAppsQuery{
    Query:           "face",
    ReturnOwnedApps: false,
}
// list all apps with the query "face"
apps, _, err := client.App.SearchApps(context.Background(), params)
```

The client is divided into logical chunks closely corresponding to the layout and structure of Apple's own documentation at <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_search_ads>.

For more sample code snippets, head over to the [examples](https://github.com/rhinonet/apple-search-ads-go/tree/master/examples) directory.

### Authentication

You may find that the code snippet above will always fail due to a lack of authorization. The Apple Search Ads API has no methods that allow for unauthorized requests. To make it easy to authenticate with Apple Search Ads, the apple-search-ads-go library offers a solution for signing and rotating JSON Web Tokens automatically. For example, the above snippet could be made to look a little more like this:

```go
import (
    "os"
    "time"

    "github.com/rhinonet/apple-search-ads-go/asa"
)

func main() {
    // Organization ID in Apple Search Ads
    orgID := "...."
	// Key ID for the given private key, described in Apple Search Ads
    keyID := "...."
    // Team ID for the given private key for the Apple Search Ads
    teamID := "...."
    // ClientID ID for the given private key for the Apple Search Ads
    clientID := "...."
    // A duration value for the lifetime of a token. Apple Search Ads does not accept a token with a lifetime of longer than 20 minutes
    expiryDuration = 20*time.Minute
    // The bytes of the private key created you have uploaded to it Apple Search Ads.
    privateKey = os.ReadFile("path/to/key")

    auth, err := asa.NewTokenConfig(orgID, keyID, teamID, clientID, expiryDuration, privateKey)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    client := asa.NewClient(auth.Client())

    // list all apps with the "face" in the authenticated user's team
    params := &asa.SearchAppsQuery{
        Offset:          0,
        Limit:           100,
        Query:           "face",
        ReturnOwnedApps: true,
    }
    
    apps, _, err := client.App.SearchApps(context.Background(), params)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
}
```

The authenticated client created here will automatically regenerate the token if it expires. Also note that all Apple Search Ads APIs are scoped to the credentials of the pre-configured key, so you can't use this API to make queries against the entire Apple Search Ads. For more information on creating the necessary credentials for the Apple Search Ads API, see the documentation at <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_search_ads/implementing_oauth_for_the_apple_search_ads_api>.

### Pagination

All requests for resource collections (apps, acls, ad groups, campaigns, etc.) support pagination. Responses for paginated resources will contain a `Pagination` property of type `PageDetail`, with `TotalResults`, `StartIndex` and `ItemsPerPage`.

```go
auth, _ := asa.NewTokenConfig(orgID, keyID, teamID, clientID, expiryDuration, privateKey)
client := asa.NewClient(auth.Client())

var allApps []asa.AppInfo
params := &asa.SearchAppsQuery{
	Offset:          0,
	Limit:           100,
	Query:           "face",
	ReturnOwnedApps: false,
}
for {
	apps, _, err := client.App.SearchApps(context.Background(), params)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	allApps = append(allApps, apps.AppInfos...)

	pageDetail := apps.Pagination
	lastOffset := pageDetail.StartIndex + len(apps.AppInfos)
	if lastOffset < pageDetail.TotalResults {
		params.Offset += int32(len(apps.AppInfos))
	} else {
		break
	}
}
```

## Contributing

This project's primary goal is to cover the entire API surface exposed by the official Apple Search Ads API. Otherwise, it's being developed to aid in internal application development by the authors. Therefore, until the package's version stabilizes with v1, there isn't a strong roadmap beyond those stated goals. However, contributions are always welcome.
